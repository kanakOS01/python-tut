Armed with makeshift weapons, we formulated a plan to reach the supposed safe havenâ€”a \033[3;91m{place2}\033[0m fortified against the undead. The journey was fraught with \033[3;91m{adj3}\033[0m, but our determination and teamwork saw us through, making the escape both \033[3;91m{adj4}\033[0m and thrilling."
